 
# Underwater Optical LED Transmitter          

A high-power, multi-wavelength LED-based transmitter designed for Underwater Optical Wireless Communication (UOWC) systems. This project aims to enable high-speed, short- to mid-range underwater data transmission using modular optical hardware and differential signaling.          

## 🔍 Project Overview    

This project was completed as part of my Master of Engineering Studies at Auckland University of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Boon-Chong Seet. It explores the use of blue (470–499nm), green (500–530nm), and yellow (550–600nm) LEDs for underwater optical data transmission. The system was designed to operate up to 4 MHz with stable signal and thermal performance.              

## ⚙️ Features  

* Multi-wavelength signaling using Blue, Green, and Yellow high-power LEDs.  

* Signal modulation via MOSFET + Gate Driver architecture.      

* Operating frequency up to 4 MHz.      

* Custom-designed modular PCB with decoupling and heat dissipation optimizations.    

* Frequency-dependent current and thermal performance testing.    

* Designed for future underwater deployment (currently tested in air).  

## 🧩 System Architecture  

**Hardware Components:**         

* IN-C33(X)TL(X) Series 3535 LEDs

* BUK98150-55A N-channel MOSFETs      

* UCC27517A Gate Driver      

* Custom-designed two-layer PCB in Altium Designer    

* Function Generator + Oscilloscope for modulation testing    

**Design Highlights:**

* Modular LED branches with selectable power output (0.5W, 1W, 2W)  

* Decoupling capacitors (100μF + 0.1μF) per branch  

* Power routing and signal isolation to minimize EMI  

* Thermal vias and copper pour to enhance dissipation    

## 🔬 Testing & Results  

Tests were conducted in lab (air environment)

**Heat Dissipation:**

Stable operation at 1.5–2W power with <80°C max component surface temp

**Frequency-Dependent Current:**    

Demonstrated working signal modulation up to 4 MHz  

**Signal Integrity:**  

Clean transitions observed via oscilloscope at key MOSFET and LED nodes

**Transmitter-Receiver Interaction:**  

Optical signal successfully received at 1–4 MHz using photodiode circuit    

## 🚀 Future Work

* Underwater testing in controlled environments      

* Integrate modulation schemes (e.g., 4-PPM, OFDM)    

* Explore custom LED packaging for higher frequency response

* Expand multi-channel receiver design
