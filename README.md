A high-frequency LED transmitter for underwater optical wireless communication.  
# Underwater Optical LED Transmitter

This project was completed as part of my Master of Engineering thesis at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), focusing on the design and testing of a high-frequency LED transmitter for underwater optical wireless communication (UWOC).

## 🔍 Project Overview

The objective was to explore the signal transmission behaviour of high-frequency visible light LEDs in water environments. The prototype was designed to be efficient, compact, and suitable for integration into future UWOC systems.  

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a high-frequency (1–20 MHz) LED transmitter driver circuit.
- Evaluate signal attenuation in water using oscilloscope-based measurements.
- Study modulation performance across varying water quality conditions.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Altium Designer (PCB layout)
- LTspice (Simulation)
- MATLAB (Data analysis)
- Oscilloscope + signal analyzer
- 470nm–499nm high-power LEDs

## 📊 Key Results

- Stable signal transmission up to 10 MHz in clear water.
- Increased attenuation observed in murky/turbid water.
- Prototype validated as baseline for future UWOC receiver integration.
